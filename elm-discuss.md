## elm-discuss

elm-discuss is the Google group aimed at Elm users to discuss items. 


### How to be constructive

- Make it easy for people to reply to you. The harder it is for people to read, the harder it is for them to reply. 
- Keep it short and sweet. Long posts tire the reader.
- Stay on topic! If you want to side-track on a certain topic, make a new thread. They're free!
- Avoid repeating what others have said. 
- Avoid posting +1s. 

### Things which are okay to post :thumbsup:

* announcements of things people are working on
* beginners requesting help, though they should be directed to the Slack channel or reddit for further questions.
* openly exploring ideas for API design, language features, without expecting others to take action as a result
* discussing pain points using specific code examples and a goal of identifying the right way to proceed right now


### Things which are not :thumbsdown:

* lobbying for reprioritization of known issues that have been discussed elsewhere
* discussing pain points through unconstructive venting
* unconstructive criticism of others' work
* personal attacks
