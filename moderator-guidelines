# Moderator Guidelines

## Spam, unreleated to Elm posts in channels.

- Delete the spam message.
- If this is the first time someone is posting spam in a channel we should write a reply advising them of this. 
- We need to agree on a way of keeping track of these users
- A recurring user should be banned

## Spamming private messages

E.g. Work offers unrelated to Elm.

- Unclear what should we do with these

## App invitations

- Many times people cannot use the auto-invite link and they ask for a manual invitation. All manual invitations should be accepted.

## App authorizations

- All app authorizations are to be rejected as we don't want source of spam that cannot be moderated.
