# Elm Slack Community Code of Conduct

The Elm Slack community is a welcoming environment where everyone can seek help and discussion on any Elm-related topic.
To ensure that our Slack remains as friendly as it currently is, this Code of Conduct documents our rules, values, and
expectations.

The members and moderators of the Elm Slack community are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal
characteristic. We do not tolerate harassment or abuse in any form.

As participants of this community we pledge to:

- __Be friendly, welcoming and inclusive.__
- __Be helpful and patient.__
  - Do not _intentionally_ post inaccurate, misleading, or deceptive technical information.
  - Do not ridicule someone's ignorance or misunderstanding.
- __Be respectful and considerate.__
  - People have different levels of experience programming, and with many types of languages. Someone who struggles with
    Elm might have 15 years of enterprise Java experience. Making assumptions about someone's background is usually
    harmful.
  - Not everyone speaks English natively. If you can understand the intent, avoid remarking on the grammar.
- __Avoid negative behaviour.__
  - Derailing a conversation: Chat conversations can move quickly and unpredictably. But, do not actively seek to
    prevent a conversation from occurring (unless the conversation itself violates this Code).
  - Unconstructive criticism: Do not merely decry the current state of affairs. Offer suggestions as to how things may
    be improved.
  - Snarking: pithy, insulting, or sniping comments.
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this frequently leads to unnecessary conflict. There's no
    reason to discuss hot-button political issues in a programming chat room.
  - Brief and common hostile behaviors that cumulatively communicate that a certain person or group is
    unwelcome.

Everyone can make a valuable contribution to this community. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for
poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable
or threatened is not a productive one.

Sometimes misunderstandings and conflicts are inevitable, but resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to
take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do
not rise to it.

We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone. As such moderators
have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments and other assets that are not aligned to this Code
of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, threatening, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the
community admin team as found [here](https://github.com/elm-community/slack#admins). Do not post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a
particular individual or group. Moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
